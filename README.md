## Hello, world!

I am currently in my last year of B. Sc. in Computer Science at [UVSQ](https://www.uvsq.fr/licence-informatique).

Working on two major projects for the last semester:
- GUI app for simulating the TCP/IP protocol
- Optimizing an attack on the 2PRESENT24 block cipher.

### Favorite Languages
  - C/C++ (serious stuff)
  - Rust (concurrent/parallel)
  - Bash (scripting)
  - Python (testing ideas)
