## Hey there!
I am a graduate student in Computer Science from [University of Versailles](https://www.uvsq.fr/licence-informatique).
Currently in my first year of Master in High Performance Computing and Simulation at [Paris-Saclay University](http://www.chps.uvsq.fr/).

### Currently working on
- Micro-benchmarking of ARM's SVE instructions (internship at LI-PaRAD)
- A lightweight MPI profiler written in Rust, designed for high-performance tracing with almost-zero overhead
- Generic, high performance data structures for C (vector, double linked list, hash map, etc...) 

### Center of interests
- Software and hardware architecture
- Code optimization
- Parallel/concurrent programming

### Programming languages
- C/C++
- Rust
- Python
- Bash
