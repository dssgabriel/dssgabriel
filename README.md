### Hello, world!
 
 - Currently in my last year of B. Sc. in Computer Science at [UVSQ](https://www.uvsq.fr/licence-informatique)
 - Working on multiple projects for the last semester! Mainly TCP/IP simulation and the optimization of block ciphers

### Favorite Languages
  - C / C++ (serious stuff)
  - Rust (concurrent/parallel)
  - Bash (scripting)
  - Python (testing cool ideas)

### Memes
- I'm on Arch (btw)
- I love Rust :)
- I use both Vim and Emacs (shocking right?!)
